Hi! Thanks for contributing to Ellie. Please make sure to note that we have a
[code of conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and a contributor license agreement that
you will be asked to sign after you make a pull request.


### Feature Request or UX change?

- Sign up for the Elm slack at http://elmlang.herokuapp.com and join the #ellie channel
- Alternatively, send an email to ellie-app@lukewestby.com
- Have a conversation about your idea!
- New features and changes to Ellie's UX are considered thoroughly and carefully. Issues and unannounced pull requests are not the correct way to propose them! Ellie is managed in the same spirit as Elm itself. You can find out more in [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSjbTC-hvqQ)

### Bug Fix?

##### Issues
Please include:
- An [SSCCE](http://sscce.org/) that reproduces the problem
- A screenshot of the problem in action

##### Pull Requests
- Reference the issue your pull request fixes
- If your PR fixes an unreported issue, please open an issue first so that maintainers can have a chance to understand whether a PR is needed or if a deeper problem exists
- If your fix includes a lot of changed lines or files then a maintainer may ask for a short explanation of why the changes your made are the best way to fix the problem
