An optional argument can be either present, absent, or null, so using a Maybe does not
fully capture the GraphQL concept of an optional argument. For example, you could have
a mutation that deletes an entry if a null argument is provided, or does nothing if
the argument is absent. See
[The official GraphQL spec section on null](http://facebook.github.io/graphql/October2016/#sec-Null-Value)
for details.
