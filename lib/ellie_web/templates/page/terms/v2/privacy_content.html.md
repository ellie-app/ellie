Last updated: May 25, 2018

Ellie ("Ellie", "us", "we", or "our") operates the https://ellie-app.com website (the "Service").

This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information when you use our Service.

We do not intentionally collect Personal Information except for specific user support purposes. Content posted using our Service is public and licensed under the MIT license.
You may request removal of Personal Information regardless of whether you originally shared it by emailing ellie@lukewestby.com.

We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

We use your Personal Information for providing and improving the Service. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, accessible at https://ellie-app.com/a/terms/2

## Information We Collect

### Publicly Accessible Code

We collect and store any information you share through our Service. This includes Elm code, HTML code, packages selected from package.elm-lang.org, and a title you may optionally
provide for a shareable code example ("Example"). We do not require that any of these contain Personal Information or otherwise proprietary information. We encourage you not
to include such information in an Example. You may submit a request to remove any Example that you or anyone else may have submitted if you believe it contains Personal Information
about you or someone else. Ellie serves as a public repository of examples for the Elm programming language, and it is important to us that it remains safe for all in fulfilling
that purpose.

### Error Reporting

Ellie also collects information about your browser and the particular actions you were attempting whenever an error occurs on our Service ("Error Data").
This Log Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser version, the pages of our Service that you visit,
the time and date of your visit, and other statistics. Error Data is securely stored by https://sentry.io/ and is manually removed when it is 7 days old.
